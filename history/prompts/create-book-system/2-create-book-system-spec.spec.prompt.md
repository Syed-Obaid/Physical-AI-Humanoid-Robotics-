# Response

I've successfully created the feature specification for the AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation System. Here's what was accomplished:

1. Created branch: 001-create-book-system
2. Created specification file: /specs/001-create-book-system/spec.md
3. Created quality checklist: /specs/001-create-book-system/checklists/requirements.md

The specification includes:
- 3 prioritized user stories covering the core workflows
- Functional requirements with testable acceptance criteria
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Edge cases to consider
- Alignment with the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

All quality criteria have been met as verified by the checklist. The specification is ready for the next phase (/sp.plan).
